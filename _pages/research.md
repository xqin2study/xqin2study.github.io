## Research Interests

**Blowups of Fluid Dynamics Models**

- Numerical investigation of the potential finite-time singularity of the Euler and Navier--Stokes equations using Adaptive Mesh, Dynamic Rescaling Equations, and Iterative Method.

- Rigorous proofs for self-similar blowups of the reduced models of the Euler and Navier--Stokes equations.
